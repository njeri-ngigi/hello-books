# hello-books
Hello-Books is a simple application that helps manage a library and its processes like stocking, tracking and renting books. With this application users are able to find and rent books. The application also has an admin section where the admin can do things like add books, delete books, increase the quantity of a book etc.


Hello books now contains 6 html files with CSS for styling and a little javascript for a more interactive design. The pages should later allow a user to login or register to the site, view, borrow and return books.
They should also let an admin add, edit or delete books
